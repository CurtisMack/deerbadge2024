The artwork on this badge is a take on the 'cyberdeer' theme that toorcamp utilizes. Since we are camping in the woods, I felt it appropriate to create a badge that was reminiscent of a horror movie, the image of the deerskull floating over a photo of doe bay is meant to look like the poster for a slasher movie set at a campground!


This project is a simple electronic die that lights up the 'eyes' of the deer skull.

You can see in the schematic that it makes use of the limited outputs on the ATtiny85 by taking advantage of the fact that most of the LEDs light in pairs to create the dice patterns.

need to add BOM
need to add link to ATtiny85 programming
